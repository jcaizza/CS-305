# CS-305
Portfolio Submission for Secure Software Practices Report - CS305

### Client Summary
**Client:** Artemis Financial  
**Project Requirement:** Artemis Financial, a financial services company, needed to secure its software to protect sensitive client data. The main goal was to prevent unauthorized access, ensure data integrity, and implement secure communications to meet industry security standards.

### Key Accomplishments in Security
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** I thoroughly reviewed the code to identify security vulnerabilities and used structured methods to address them. 
- **Importance of Secure Coding:** Writing secure code is crucial to prevent data breaches and maintain trust with clients. Secure software adds immense value by protecting a company’s reputation, reducing risk, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

### Challenges and Learning Points
- **Challenges:** One of the main challenges was configuring SSL to secure the communications between the client and server. This setup required careful attention to detail and troubleshooting.
- **Learning Points:** Using the OWASP Dependency Check tool was helpful for identifying potential vulnerabilities in the project’s dependencies and reinforced the importance of checking for third-party risks.

### Layers of Security Added
- **Security Measures:** I added HTTPS to secure the communication layer and implemented SHA-256 hashing to verify data integrity.
- **Future Assessment Tools:** In future projects, I would use additional security tools, like SonarQube for continuous code analysis, to help identify vulnerabilities throughout the development process.

### Testing and Validation
- **Functionality Testing:** After refactoring, I tested each application feature to confirm that everything functioned as expected.
- **Vulnerability Testing:** I used the OWASP Dependency Check tool to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced and that the application met security requirements.

### Resources and Tools
- **Tools Used:** OWASP Dependency Check, Maven, SHA-256 hashing, and SSL certificates.
- **Helpful for Future Projects:** These tools are essential for conducting security checks and implementing encryption for data integrity, and they will be valuable in future development assignments.

### Portfolio Showcase
- **Value to Employers:** This project highlights my skills in secure coding, vulnerability assessment, and the use of encryption to protect data. It demonstrates my ability to apply industry-standard security practices to real-world projects effectively.
